## Final Data Analysis and Visualization Project Details

- Find a multivariate data set to explore
- Write a mini paper about it (see next slide for details)
- Use techniques from class
- Present Project
- Use at least two-three different techniques from class as appropriate for your data. Interpret the results appropriately. Recognize and understand limitations in the data.

## Association of Eating Habits and Physical Conditions with Obesity Levels from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia

## Brief

For my project, I decided to choose a dataset on eating habits, physical conditions, and obesity levels. I performed multivariate analysis techniques, learned in class, to determine important contributors to obesity levels, and presented my key findings to the class.
