### STAT 71700 Multivariate Analysis

**Instructor Information:**

- Vitaly Druker

#### Course Overview

STAT 717 (Multivariate Analysis) presents the concepts and methods of multivariate analysis. Matrix algebra will be reviewed and used extensively but the focus will be on what methods for analyzing multivariate data are available and when they should be applied. This emphasis on data analysis requires the use of a good statistical software. The R language is chosen because it is widely used, cutting edge and free.

## Final Data Analysis and Visualization Project Details

- Find a multivariate data set to explore
- Write a mini paper about it (see next slide for details)
- Use techniques from class
- Present Project
- Use at least two-three different techniques from class as appropriate for your data. Interpret the results appropriately. Recognize and understand limitations in the data. 

-----

- **Introduction**
  - Description of problem
  - Background on data set
  - What’s the goal?
- **Description of Data**
  - Counts, histograms etc. 
  - What do the columns mean?
  - What are some of the considerations you will have to make for the analysis
- **Methods and Results**
  - Keep this section ‘factual’ e.g. don’t draw too many conclusions – just report results
  - Data Transformation
  - Modeling Technique
  - Results
- **Discussion**
  - What did you learn about the data set? Which variables are important?
  - How could analysis be improved (e.g. more data?)
  - How does this translate to real world change?

## Association of Eating Habits and Physical Conditions with Obesity Levels from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia

## Brief

For my project, I decided to choose a dataset on eating habits, physical conditions, and obesity levels. I performed multivariate analysis techniques, learned in class, to determine important contributors to obesity levels, and presented my key findings to the class.
