#### Course Overview

STAT 717 (Multivariate Analysis) presents the concepts and methods of multivariate analysis. Matrix algebra will be reviewed and used extensively but the focus will be on what methods for analyzing multivariate data are available and when they should be applied. This emphasis on data analysis requires the use of a good statistical software. The R language is chosen because it is widely used, cutting edge and free.
