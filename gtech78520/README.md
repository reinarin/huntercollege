### GTECH 78520 Data Analysis and Visualization with R

**Instructor Information:**

- Allan Frei
- Peter J. Marcotullio
- Shipeng Sun

#### Course Description and Objectives

This course introduces the basics of R and the practical knowledge of data cleaning, re-organization, modeling, statistics, and analysis for research and visualization, particularly in geospatial fields. The class meets once a week for 3 hours per session with hands-on practices. Three different members of the Department of Geography and Environmental Science, as identified above, lead the class.

The goal of the course is to introduce students to the use of R programming for univariate and multivariate analysis and visualization, mapping and spatial analysis.

#### Learning Outcomes

At the end of the semester, students will be able to:

1. Use RStudio to perform basic data analysis functions including Input/Output, basic statistical analyses, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and graphical output.
2. Use RStudio to perform regression analysis, and to develop, test, and execute R script.
3. Use advanced R programming to import, clean, transform, and summarize data
4. Use ggplot2 to visualize data in points, lines, area charts and smoothed curves
5. Import and map spatial data using R sf and ggplot2 packages
6. Conduct basic cluster analysis and regression using spatial data
